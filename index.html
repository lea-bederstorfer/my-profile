			<h1>Hi ! I'm L√©a. Welcome to my universe !</h1>

			<p>Who am I ? 
			I'm 18 and I'm currently studying at ESSEC Business School in Paris. I am really extrovert and sociable, but I'm particularly a very open-minded person. Indeed, I like a lot of different things, but I will show you here my 3 main passions. What a difficult choice !

			<h2>Travelling ‚úà</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				I'm passionate about travel. Indeed, I love discovering new cultures, traditions, people and landscapes. Thanks to my family, I had the opportunity to travel in many countries such as Greece, Mauritius, UK, France, Germany, Belgium, ect... But the best journey I ever had was of course in Italy. My dream consists in seeing as many countries as possible... and thanks to ESSEC Business School I will acomplish a little part of this dream since I will do the IBEA exchange which enables me to travel in 4 different countries during 2 years (Germany, USA, Singapour and Brazil).

			<h2>Sports üèÖ</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				I love sports. Indeed, I love adrenaline and exercise. Sport helps me in my daily life, on one hand in the morning by giving me energy and on the other hand by reducing my stress after a long day. I have tried many different sports (dance, karate, swimming, soccer, volleyball, etc.) but my favorite is Handball.

			<h2>Singing üé§</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				I've been singing since I was little. Over the years, I managed to improve thanks to my grandfather. And now I do singing competitions, concerts and I am part of the ESSEC music association "Jam ESSEC". I couldn't even explain why I love singing, I just know that when I sing I have an inexplicable feeling of happiness.
